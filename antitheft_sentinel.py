"""
Anti-theft sentinel  -  alerts you on Telegram when a login fails.

This is the half of the anti-theft setup that has to run BEFORE anyone logs
in, so it can catch a thief failing your PIN or password at the lock screen.

It is deliberately separate from monitor_bot.py, for two reasons:

  * It is meant to run as a Windows service / scheduled task under the SYSTEM
    account, started at boot. SYSTEM can read the Security event log (where
    failed logins are recorded); a normal program cannot.
  * It only SENDS Telegram messages, it never polls for commands. That means
    it does not clash with monitor_bot.py, which does poll -- Telegram allows
    only one poller per bot token, but any number of senders.

It can run two ways:

  once   - look at the last few minutes for failed logins and report them,
           then exit. This is what the event-triggered scheduled task uses:
           Windows runs it each time a failed-login event is written.
  watch  - stay running and poll the log every few seconds. Useful for
           testing, or if you would rather run it as a plain background task.

Screenshots are not attempted here: before login there is no desktop to
capture. A webcam grab IS attempted, because the camera is a separate device
-- but at the lock screen Windows often denies it, so it is best-effort and
its absence is never treated as an error.
